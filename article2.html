            <h2>Our society is blind</h2>
            <br>

            <p>I would like to clarify that this text does not take a political stance because, in most cases, all politicians in Brazil act this way, regardless of whether they are left or right-wing. At the end of the day, they all shake hands while the people fight with their greatest ally: themselves.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Governments always tend to favor billionaires/millionaires, even when they claim to fight against them. Brazil is often living proof of this. Currently, we live in a country with over 200 million inhabitants, being one of the largest global economies, yet we still have a large portion of the population without basic sanitation or access to decent education. And those who do have access to education often do not value it. These individuals should not be blamed, as our education system is completely shaped by people who studied 30 years ago or, worse, never studied at all. These individuals often aim to implement supposedly innovative ideas in education, such as creating extensionist subjects like financial mathematics, innovation, and environmental topics. There's no real issue in creating such subjects, but the primary problem lies in the fact that our country is still one of the worst in the world in the PISA ranking, which is based on basic knowledge. In other words, the number of new and innovative subjects tends to grow, while basic education indexes remain outdated and ridiculous. This example can also be applied to other topics, such as a certain state's government creating a specialized ambulance for LGBTQIA+ people. I reiterate that this is not a problem; LGBTQIA+ individuals absolutely deserve respect. However, this state is the sixth most violent in the country. Instead of focusing on the core issues, the state government tends to please its residents with progressive themes to 'show work,' as they don’t genuinely care about how the population will fare in four years when their term is nearing its end. They avoid taking actions with long-term positive returns, such as reforming education or finishing projects left by previous administrations. Instead, they take immediate measures to prove they are working, abandoning previous governments' projects (perhaps led by the opposition) and starting new ones to 'show work' while undermining their opponents by pointing out unfinished or abandoned works.</p>
            <br>

            <p>And of course, the point I want to make, considering the title of this article, is that society is completely blind to government actions. Just as Bolsonaro supporters in 2020 claimed everything was fine during the COVID-19 pandemic, that Brazil was safe, and that vaccination was unnecessary, Lula's supporters now claim everything is fine in his government. They dismiss fiscal issues as irrelevant, arguing that the bigger problem (Bolsonaro in power) has already been dealt with. When people with minimal sense attempt to question events like the record-breaking dengue cases in 2024 and why the government did not import a vaccine from Japan, the response we get is that we are "acting like inferiors" and should wait for the development of the Brazilian vaccine.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Sometimes, I feel like there’s no solution for this country. However, as a young person without the means to leave, I choose to believe that there is still some hope while I remain stuck here with several generations of functional illiterates who are as ignorant as a rock.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was more of a vent than something technical. I've been away from coding for a while due to life factors.</p>
