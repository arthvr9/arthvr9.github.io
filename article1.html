            <h2>How AI is killing the internet</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Before jumping to any hasty conclusions, I want to clarify that I do not support censorship, nor do I believe the internet should be regulated or controlled by any authority. The internet is not, but ideally should be, a free space, decentralized and entirely anonymous. However, for us to achieve a supposed utopian future in which these ideals become reality, we need to control the abuses that are happening and likely to happen, so that such activities remain confined within the internet without affecting external agents. This approach could help maintain the internet as anonymous and decentralized in this future utopia. Unfortunately, while we are not there yet, please read my manifesto on this subject, which I believe should be getting far more attention.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In recent days, I've been using the internet extensively, as I'm looking for a new job and working on enhancing my skills in some new programming languages for various projects. But one thing that has been infuriating is the sheer amount of AI-generated content I come across. And I’m not just talking about cute or funny cat videos, but rather people exploiting Artificial Intelligence to create deepfakes and scams, even using Brazilian celebrities as guinea pigs for their fraudulent schemes. This is something that, about three years ago, would have been unimaginable. AI emerged so recently, and it’s “killing” the internet in such a rapid way that it almost escapes our perception. For a computer scientist, it’s unacceptable to see a technology that was meant to be revolutionary and improve the internet and our lives by assisting us with tedious, repetitive tasks being misused to perpetrate scams. Even though the creators of these AIs are not responsible for what users generate with them, I believe that failing to establish restrictions on the content produced by them is as complicit as those who create these contents.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Think carefully before launching a project that could impact people. Don’t deploy something that has the capability to show a person’s face doing something they never did unless it is thoroughly vetted by your testing team. And above all, establish a dedicated ethics department within AI development companies—not to dictate what is or isn’t right, but rather to provide insight into how cruel the internet can sometimes be and advise developers on what should be hard-coded to ensure the AI does not exceed moral boundaries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I know this is a considerably annoying topic to see discussed by people without technical knowledge, and even though I haven’t expressed everything I’d like to say, I hope people can grasp my message.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And, before, i forget:</p>
